1. “You did helped me” as input is not giving desired output. We need more training data.
2.  It is not giving output for “Mandarin Chinese” and “English”. We need more training data.
3.  It is giving the output for even just word “Hindi” without any questions. We need better NLU model.
4. Even after getting feedback it is asking for next question. It should give the alternative to the user whether they want to ask or not.
5. Even though the feedback is not needed it is giving output similar to the feedback one. Better NLU model is required.
6. Some of the negative feedback is not working. NLU model need to be improved.
